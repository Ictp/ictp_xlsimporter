Ictp_xlsimporter
================

Indico external module for creating Contributions from a customized XLS file


HOW DOES IT WORK?
-----------------

Install 'IMPORTERS' plugin and enable 'Ictp XLS importer to Contributions' importer.
In EDIT mode, from you TIMETABLE, you will find an IMPORTXLS button: just click it and select your XLS file.
An example of the XLS file is equipped: ictp_exmple.xls
With this plugin only TALKS and BREAKS are recognized. SESSION objects infos are used (look inside XLS) but not created in Indico.
